# Automated Testing Setup

This repository has been automatically configured with GitHub Actions for continuous testing.

## Setup Instructions

## Setting up GitHub Actions for KHarish15/testing8

This project uses HTML with Playwright testing.  Since there's no JavaScript or external dependencies, the workflow focuses on local testing and verification, with Playwright for browser interactions (though not *against* the HTML from the repo itself, but from running it locally).

**1. Adding the Workflow File**

Create a file named `.github/workflows/test.yml` in your repository.  This file will contain the workflow for GitHub Actions.  Because this is an HTML file, no compilation or build is needed.  Instead, it's about running Playwright to test the functionality of whatever you are envisioning with the HTML as the user interface.

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main  # Or your main branch

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          npm install playwright
          
      - name: Run tests
        run: npx playwright test
```

**2. Environment Variables**

No environment variables are needed for this project.

**3. Dependencies**

You need to install Playwright globally.

```bash
npm install -g playwright
```

**4. Configuring the Test Framework (Playwright)**

* **Local Server:**  Because you're using HTML, you'll need a local server to run it.  Use `http-server` from npm:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

* **Running the server:** Navigate to the directory containing your `index.html` file in your terminal, and run:

```bash
http-server
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

* **Playwright Setup:** You need to create a `playwright.config.ts` or `.js` file in the project's root to configure Playwright. Because your HTML may not be directly tested, you'll use Playwright to interact with the page, likely via page load or event testing rather than testing against a static file.



* **Writing tests (example):** Create a folder called `tests` and add a file like `mytests.spec.ts`.


```typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('my test', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('http://localhost:8080'); // Replace with your local server URL
  // Assertions to validate page elements/interactions.  Note that your HTML must have meaningful IDs/classes for these assertions to target.
  const title = await page.locator('title').textContent();
  expect(title).toBe('Login Page');
  // Add more assertions as needed.
});
```

**5. Viewing Test Results**

Playwright generates reports in a directory within the project.  The output format is text-based.


**6. Troubleshooting Common Issues**

* **Playwright installation errors:** Verify you have Node.js and npm installed.  Re-run `npm install playwright`.

* **Browser errors:** Ensure the local server is running correctly.  If tests fail, check the Playwright console for more specific errors.  Consider running the tests in debug mode to identify the failing interaction step.

**7. Project-Specific Configuration Steps (HTML)**

* **HTML Validation:** Use tools like the W3C validator to ensure your HTML is well-formed.  Ensure the structure and tags conform to HTML5 standards, and address any errors.

* **Cross-Browser Testing:** Playwright itself addresses cross-browser testing to an extent, but it requires that you use Playwright to test across different browsers, potentially via the config file. You must manually verify your HTML renders correctly on different browsers. Tools like BrowserStack can be useful for cross-browser testing beyond the scope of Playwright.


**Important Considerations:**

* **Test Coverage:** Your HTML project likely won't have a huge amount of code to test, so you can achieve relatively high test coverage with this basic setup. This example just tests the initial page load. Add more tests to cover different user interactions as needed.
* **Page Structure:** Your HTML elements should have proper IDs, classes, or other selectors for Playwright to interact with.

This setup gets you started.  Remember to adapt the testing logic to match the specific user interactions your HTML needs to cover.
